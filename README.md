# Oooo
Out of Order Observer
(Couldn't come up with a better name).

This is a toy model of an in-order 5 stage pipeline and an out of order pipeline. To run, download the Godot game engine, import this as a project, select the "Driver5Stage.tscn" scene for 5 stage and "DriverOoO" scene for out of order, choose your configuration from the Inspector on the right, and click Play Scene. Better ways to run this hopefully coming soon. You'll need to download FiraSans-Regular.ttf from somewhere into the repo to run the project.
